ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the 3rd edition of The OP Superchain Roundup! ðŸŒŸ

Join us as we uncover the exciting world of the Optimism Ecosystem. In this newsletter, we'll bring you all the latest updates and developments on the OP Ecosystem. Let's get started!

## Major happenings in the Ecosystem
### OP Mainnet
#### Optimism Announces $26 Million Airdrop #3

- Optimism has announced its third airdrop for its governance members.
- The airdrop involves allocating 19.4 million OP tokens ($26 million) to 31,870 addresses that participated in delegation activities of the Optimism Collective DAO.
- Rewards were calculated based on the number of OP tokens delegated and the duration of holding. Eligibility criteria required a minimum threshold of 18,000 units of delegated OP tokens held for at least 100 days between January 20 and July 20.
- Rewards were capped at 10,000 OP tokens per address to ensure fair distribution.
- Despite $OP's -20% price decline since January '23, Airdrop #3 would've pushed you 13% into profit for merely delegating $OP.
- Only 0.45% of the total 19% airdrop supply was allocated to Round #3 and by far the biggest OP airdrop is yet to happen with over 570M OP to be airdropped.

#### Velodrome Introduces New Concentrated AMM, Velodrome Slipstream

- Velodrome introduces a new AMM called Velodrome Slipstream with a focus on improving capital efficiency for stable pools and less volatile assets.
- Slipstream aims to add concentrated liquidity pools (clAMM) to complement existing sAMM and vAMM models.
- The primary objectives of Slipstream are persistent LPing, incentivizing staking for VELO emissions, maximizing emissions efficiency, and maintaining protocol decentralization.
- Velodrome plans to capture more volume and fees from high volume pairs currently dominated by Uniswap liquidity providers.
- Slipstream's clAMM pools leverage UniV3's trusted contracts.
- Gauge rewards are distributed over time and only in the active tick, maximizing capital efficiency.
- A fee module and an unstaked liquidity fee rake/tax will be implemented to compensate LPs and encourage staking.

### Base
#### Coinbase's Base Surges to All-Time High in Transactions Driven by FriendTech Resurgence

- Base recently achieved an all-time high in daily transactions, surpassing 1.8 million, a sharp increase from its August figures.
- The platform has attracted nearly $380 million in total assets locked with over $20 million in daily trading volume.
- FriendTech has contributed massively to the daily trading volume, reaching a peak trading volume of nearly $18.5 million. The resurgence of FriendTech has positively impacted Base's activity.
- While Base has shown impressive growth, it still trails behind more established blockchains like Polygon and Binance Smart Chain in terms of transaction volume and daily active users.
- Base has faced security challenges, with four reported attacks in the past month, including a significant fraud incident resulting in losses exceeding $6.4 million.

### Ancient8
#### Ancient8 Launches Gaming-Focused Layer 2 Chain on OP Stack

- Ancient8 has launched the Ancient8 Chain, a gaming-focused Ethereum Layer 2 chain.
- The chain utilizes the Optimism Superchain, offering scalability, EVM compatibility, security, and interoperability.
- The chain aims to onboard the next 100 million Web3 citizens and address the challenges faced by Web3 gaming.
- The Ancient8 Chain is led by the parent company Ancient8 Collective, comprising core gaming partners.
- Ancient8's suite of products provides game studios with seamless access to launch, onboard, localize, market, and engage.
- Ancient8 aims to create a decentralized ecosystem that empowers users and developers in the Web3 gaming space.

### Infrastructure
#### EigenLabs to Launch EigenDA, A Data Availability Solution for Ethereum Layer 2 Rollups

- EigenLabs is preparing to launch EigenDA, a data availability solution for Ethereum Layer 2 rollups.
- Projects such as Celo, Mantle, Fluent, Offshore, and Layer N are considering integrating EigenDA into their Layer 2 setups.
- EigenDA aims to reduce data storage costs for Layer 2 Ethereum rollups and improve data availability.
- The solution implements data partitioning and storage methods to distribute data across multiple nodes, allowing for cheaper transaction costs.
- EigenDA will be the first actively validated service (AVS) on EigenLayer, leveraging restaking and a proof of custody mechanism for data accessibility.
- EigenLayer's total value locked exceeded $230 million after the second round of deposit caps for liquid staking assets.

## Highlights of the Week
### Canto Migrates into an Ethereum Layer 2 and The L2 Stack War
![image](https://github.com/The-OP-Superchain-Roundup/weekly-roundup/assets/147209458/ed744fa8-8ac2-480b-a639-9c8530a96bd1)

- Canto is planning to migrate to Ethereum and become a Layer 2 network. The migration will leverage the Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK). 
- This raises interesting questions around which L2 stack other chains could adopt if they also migrate to Ethereum L2. For example, Fantom is another blockchain that has indicated interest in transitioning to a Layer 2.
- Here is a brief comparison of leading stacks:
- OP Stack is the most flexible and open stack that enables developers to fully customize and deploy permissionless L2s without needing approval. Supports creating app-specific chains.
- Arbitrum Orbit is a more restrictive stack where data availability relies on Arbitrum One. Requires approval for commercial use. Positioned as an L3.
- Polygon CDK is an evolving stack that allows some customization of data availability and sequencing but mandates shared ZK components. Fully open source.
- ZK Stack is an upgrade to zkSync focused on layered ZK proof aggregation. Also requires permission for commercial use.
- As adoption grows, it will be telling to see which stack gain prominence - the permissionless customizability of OP Stack or the increased standardization of other frameworks. Canto's choice may influence other migrating chains.

Thatâ€™s it for today, folks. See ya next Friday. ðŸ§¢
