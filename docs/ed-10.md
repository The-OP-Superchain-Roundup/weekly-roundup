ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the 10th edition of The OP Superchain Roundup! ðŸŒŸ 

Join us as we uncover the exciting world of the Optimism Ecosystem. In this newsletter, we'll bring you all the latest updates and developments on the OP Ecosystem. Let's get started!

## Major happenings in the Ecosystem
### OP Mainnet

- Optimism's Bedrock upgrade introduced an EIP-1559 style gas price mechanism.
- This eliminated MEV sandwich bot activity on Optimism.
- Sandwich bots try to censor/delay transactions to make profitable trades in between.
- EIP-1559 reduces predictability of transaction inclusion by removing first-price auction.
- Bots no longer know exact gas price needed, making their strategy less effective.
  
### Goverance

- Optimism has initiated the third round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) voting.
- The voting period will end on December 7th.
- A total of 30 million OP tokens will be allocated to 643 contributors within the Optimism ecosystem.

- Canyon is the first post-Bedrock network upgrade by Optimism.
- The upgrade will activate on testnets on November 14th at 17:00 UTC.
- Canyon has already been successfully activated on a devnet in collaboration with Conduit and Base.
- The upgrade must pass through the Optimism governance process to be activated on OP Mainnet and other mainnets in the Superchain.
- The Canyon upgrade includes support for Shanghai and Capella hardforks, minor bug fixes, and OP Stack specific changes.
- The EIP-1559 denominator will be increased from 50 to 250 to reduce the rate of change of the basefee.
- Canyon modifies the protocol to handle unclosed channels and adds a new field to the deposit transaction receipt encoding.
- Node operators need to upgrade their nodes following the Canyon upgrade.

#### Celestia Mainnet is Live

- Celestia has launched its mainnet beta after distributing its native TIA token to 580,000 users through an airdrop worth around $120 million.
- Celestia is a modular blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues by using specific channels for speed and execution. 
- It uses data availability sampling (DAS) to verify data.
- The mainnet launch enables other modular chains to use Celestia as a data availability and consensus layer. 
- This marks the arrival of the first live modular data availability network with DAS.

## Highlights of the Week

- Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange, is reportedly in discussions with blockchain infrastructure firms to develop its own Layer 2 blockchain network.
- The potential partners being considered include Polygon, Matter Labs, and Nil Foundation.
- The conversations regarding Kraken's plans are still ongoing and have not been made public yet.
- Coinbase, a rival exchange, launched its own Layer 2 network called Base earlier this year.
- Optimistic Rollups, which utilize off-chain computation and state storage, are currently dominant in the Layer 2 market, while ZK Rollups rely on zero-knowledge proofs for individual transactions.
- It is speculated that if Kraken launches a Layer 2 network, it will likely be based on ZK technology.
- Kraken's spokesperson stated that they are always looking for new industry challenges and opportunities but have nothing further to share at this time.

Thatâ€™s it for today, folks. See ya next Friday. ðŸ§¢
