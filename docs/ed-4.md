- The Optimism Collective has opened applications for the third round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF).
- RetroPGF Round 3 aims to allocate 30 million OP tokens to builders, artists, creators, and educators who have made a positive impact on the Optimism Collective.
- The application deadline for RetroPGF Round 3 is October 23rd.
- RetroPGF is open to all contributors in the Optimism ecosystem, including developers, educators, creators, writers, and evangelists.
- The RetroPGF application process involves creating an Optimist Profile to track contributions to the Collective.
- RetroPGF has had a significant impact on the ecosystem, supporting the creation of public goods and providing recognition to contributors

- Optimism is conducting a private sale of 116 million OP tokens, worth approximately $162.4 million.
- The tokens will be transferred immediately, and the sale is intended for treasury management purposes.
- The purchasers will have a two-year lockup period and can delegate the tokens to third parties for governance participation.
- This sale comes from the unallocated portion of the OP token treasury, representing 30% of the initial token supply.
- Optimism previously transferred 130 million OP tokens for treasury management and conducted an airdrop of 19.4 million OP tokens.

### Base
#### Base token not ruled out entirely

- Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal has stated that the possibility of a new token for Coinbase's Layer 2 network, Base, has not been completely ruled out.
- Although Coinbase initially stated that they did not plan to issue a new network token for Base, Grewal mentioned in an interview that it is not something they have entirely dismissed.
- Coinbase's current focus is on providing tools and technology for users to experiment with, and they aim to expand opportunities for others to exercise their creativity.
- Base, Coinbase's Layer 2 network, has seen a surge in daily transactions, surpassing the volumes of competing Ethereum Layer 2 solutions Arbitrum and Optimism.
- The recent increase in Base's daily transaction count has been attributed to factors like the launch of Friend.tech and the "Onchain Summer" initiative.

#### Coinbase's Pessimism Boosts Security for Base and OP Stack

- Base has launched a security enhancement system called "Pessimism."
- Pessimism is an open-source monitoring system designed to enhance the security of the OP Stack and other EVM-compatible blockchains.
- Coinbase has been using Pessimism to monitor the Base mainnet since its launch and is now making it open source under an MIT license.
- Pessimism aims to identify protocol vulnerabilities specific to the OP Stack, including withdrawal enforcement, fault detection, and events within the EVM blockchain.
- It supports overseeing user withdrawal security, detecting faults, upholding balance limits, and identifying events within smart contracts.
- Pessimism alerts the team when security threats or abnormal activities are detected.
- Base plans to introduce additional features to address potential protocol threats.

### Infrastructure
#### Celestia Announces 60 Million Token Airdrop

- Celestia Foundation is initiating the Genesis Drop, which marks the start of the first modular data availability network.
- TIA (Celestia's native asset) enables participation in network consensus, decentralized governance, and payment for blobspace.
- The Genesis Drop invites eligible developers and onchain addresses from Ethereum rollups, Cosmos Hub, and Osmosis to join Celestia and secure the network.
- Eligible developers and addresses can add their address to the Celestia genesis block by visiting genesis.celestia.org.
- The Genesis Drop allocates 60 million TIA (6% of total supply) across different categories, including research and public goods, early modular ecosystem, and stakers/relayers.
- TIA is used to pay for blobspace and can be used as a gas token and currency for launching new blockchains.
- Celestia uses proof-of-stake for consensus and allows TIA holders to vote on network parameters and govern the community pool.
- The Genesis Drop claiming period concludes on October 17, 2023, and unclaimed tokens will be allocated to developers and accounts who have submitted addresses.
- Celestia Labs, the company behind the protocol, achieved unicorn status after raising $55 million.

## Highlights of the Week
### And The L2 Stack War Continues with Celo

- Polygon Labs has proposed using its Chain Development Kit (CDK) to facilitate Celo's migration to Ethereum Layer 2.
- The proposal suggests deploying an L2 using Polygon CDK, which allows existing L1s to convert to Ethereum L2s with minimal friction and modularity.
- Polygon CDK is an open-source toolset based on zero-knowledge rollup technology and offers Ethereum's full security via ZK proofs.
- Several blockchain ventures, including Canto, Astar, Immutable, IDEX, and Palm Network, are collaborating with Polygon Labs for Ethereum Layer 2 migration.
- Celo's core development team, cLabs, had previously proposed using OP Labs' OP Stack for the Layer 2 transition.
- Other teams exploring Ethereum Layer 2 migrations are considering both Polygon CDK and Optimism Labs' OP Stack, which emphasize zero-knowledge rollups and optimistic rollups, respectively.

Thatâ€™s it for today, folks. See ya next Friday. ðŸ§¢
