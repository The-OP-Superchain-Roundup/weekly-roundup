- Manta Network has launched the mainnet of Manta Pacific, a Layer 2 blockchain for zero-knowledge-enabled apps.
- Manta Pacific was developed using a modified version of Optimism's OP Stack by Caldera.
- The network utilizes Celestia's data availability solution to reduce data fees and enable on-chain interactions.
- Manta Network raised $25 million in a Series A funding round led by Polychain Capital.
- During the testnet phase, Manta Pacific saw participation from over 150,000 wallet addresses.
- The Pacific network already hosts applications such as zkHoldEm, zkMe, and zkPass, which leverage zero-knowledge circuits.

The trading volumes on the social media platform friend.tech have experienced a significant drop of 95%.

Despite sharp revenue decline, the friend.tech team has presented metrics demonstrating that user engagement remains relatively robust.

New user growth slowed considerably, but existing users stayed active. Over 75% of key holders use the app daily, 50% still active weekly. 

#### Aerodrome Reaches Over $170M Locked Within 24 Hours

Aerodrome is a fork of Velodrome Finance, the largest DEX on Optimism in terms of revenue and TVL.

Aerodrome has surpassed Velodrome in terms of TVL, reaching over $170 million in just 24 hours.

Aerodrome's success has enabled the Base network to jump ahead of zkSync Era and become the third-ranked L2 in terms of TVL after Arbitrum and Optimism.

Base's total value locked (TVL) doubled to $390 million following the launch of Aerodrome.

The growth of Aerodrome and Base's TVL is seen as a validation of the thesis that ecosystem-native DEXs can win, according to Aerodrome's co-founder Alexander Cutler.

#### Base Mainnet Experienced a Half-Hour Outage

The Base mainnet experienced a half-hour outage on Sep 6 due to internal infrastructure issues.

The development team identified and resolved the issue, assuring users that no funds were at risk.

This outage was the first major technical hiccup for Base, prompting comparisons to other blockchains like Solana.

The chain is now operational again.

### Public Goods Network
#### PGN Mainnet secures over $300k for Ethereum Infrastructure Projects

Public Goods Network (PGN) launched its mainnet on July 25th. It aims to support public goods and provide an accessible platform for users and builders.

Users can bridge their assets to PGN through the official bridge or Layerswap bridge for seamless asset transfer and interoperability with Ethereum.

PGN allocates a significant portion of transaction fees to support public goods projects, generating funding for them automatically when developers run dApps on the network.

Gitcoin's first round on PGN concluded successfully, securing over $300k funds for open-source Ethereum Infrastructure projects.

## Highlights of the Week
### Optimism and Base Announce Revenue Sharing and Token Swap Agreement, Valuing Base at $1.05 Billion

Coinbase-backed Layer 2 Base and Optimism network's governance body, Optimism Collective, to collaborate on revenue and governance sharing agreement.

Base will contribute 2.5% of total sequencer revenue or 15% of net profits (whichever is greater) to Optimism Collective.

In return, Base will receive up to 118 million OP tokens ($175 million) over six years.

Base and OP Mainnet will share upgrades to remain compatible, homogeneous, and eventually interoperable in a Superchain future.

Upgrades will be governed by Optimism governance.

Our thoughts: This is a typical ‚Äústock swap‚Äù agreement that we often see in TradFi. In effect, OP used its 2.75% "equity" ($158 million) to exchange for 15% of Base Chain's "equity," valuing Base Chain at $1.05 billion. 

That‚Äôs it for today, folks. See ya next Friday. üß¢
