ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the 2st edition of The OP Superchain Roundup! ðŸŒŸ

Join us as we uncover the exciting world of the Optimism Ecosystem. In this newsletter, we'll bring you all the latest updates and developments on the OP Ecosystem. Let's get started!

## Major happenings in the Ecosystem
### Manta Pacific

- Manta Network has launched the mainnet of Manta Pacific, a Layer 2 blockchain for zero-knowledge-enabled apps.
- Manta Pacific was developed using a modified version of Optimism's OP Stack by Caldera.
- The network utilizes Celestia's data availability solution to reduce data fees and enable on-chain interactions.
- Manta Network raised $25 million in a Series A funding round led by Polychain Capital.
- During the testnet phase, Manta Pacific saw participation from over 150,000 wallet addresses.
- The Pacific network already hosts applications such as zkHoldEm, zkMe, and zkPass, which leverage zero-knowledge circuits.

### opBNB
#### opBNB Mainnet is Live

- BNB Chain has publicly launched opBNB, a Layer 2 network aimed at scaling decentralized apps in the BNB Chain ecosystem.
- opBNB was developed using Optimism's OP Stack and underwent comprehensive testing before the mainnet launch.
- It allows developers to deploy Ethereum-compatible dApps on an off-chain layer, secured by BNB Smart Chain using optimistic rollup technology.
- The goal is to increase transaction speed and reduce fees for dApps.
- The opBNB testnet was launched in June, followed by a limited mainnet release in August.
- The public mainnet launch concludes the testing phase.
- opBNB is part of the BNB Chain ecosystem, which includes BNB Smart Chain, opBNB, zkBNB, BNB Beacon Chain, and BNB Greenfield.
  
### Base
#### Base Ecosystem Fund Announces First Six Investments in Onchain Projects

- The Base Ecosystem Fund, led by Coinbase Ventures, has announced its first six investments.
- The fund aims to invest in onchain projects building on Base.
- The first six investments are Avantis, BSX, Onboard, OpenCover, Paragraph, and Truflation.
- Avantis is an oracle-based synthetic derivatives protocol.
- BSX is building a decentralized limit order book for trading with leverage.
- Onboard provides an onchain fiat-to-crypto path for users in developing markets.
- OpenCover is an L2 insurance aggregator that protects against onchain risks.
- Paragraph is an onchain creator platform for content creators.
- Truflation is an onchain financial oracle that reports daily inflation data.

#### friend.tech Resurgence

- Decentralized social network friend.tech experiences a resurgence in user activity and total value locked (TVL).
- Within the last four days, the TVL on friend.tech has doubled to surpass $30 million.
- The platform witnessed $17.5 million in daily trading volume on September 13, the highest ever recorded.
- Cumulative revenue exceeds $7 million with only a month of operation.
- The surge in activity on friend.tech may be attributed to the perception that its chats are like yield farms and the addition of non-crypto figures joining the platform.

### Synpase
#### Synapse Labs Launches Testnets for Synapse Interchain Network (SIN) and Synapse Chain

- Synapse Labs has launched testnets for the Synapse Chain and Synapse Interchain Network (SIN).
- Synapse Chain is an Ethereum-based optimistic rollup that serves as the data availability layer for the Interchain Network.
- Synapse Chain is built on the Syn OP stack, modified to be a natively interchain rollup.
- SIN is an optimistic proof-of-stake interchain network that enables trustless communication and settlement between chains.
- The Interchain Network uses Synapse Chain as its coordination hub, leveraging its transaction confirmation speed and Ethereum as the data availability layer of last resort.
- The Synapse Interchain Network testnet is live, and contracts are deployed on Synapse Chain testnet, Arbitrum Sepolia, and Ethereum Sepolia.

## Highlights of the Week
### Should DAOs Build Their Own Appchains?
![image](https://github.com/The-OP-Superchain-Roundup/weekly-roundup/assets/147209458/dd8675c0-4206-4ffa-baa5-dcd540b0d116)

- Thereâ€™s been a discussion on Twitter between the Lyra team and the Thales team on whether it makes sense for a DAO to build their own appchain. Below are their arguments.
- In favour of building own rollup (Muir)
- Scaling Ethereum and achieving horizontal scalability are essential reasons for building a custom rollup.
- Gas-intensive applications like Lyra v2 would struggle to compete for gas on existing rollup solutions.
- Revenue generation is a significant advantage of running their own rollup, as it allows capturing fees instead of paying them to external L2 solutions.
- Customizability enables features like sponsored transactions, simplifying user experiences and promoting mass adoption.
- Against building own rollup (Danijel)
- Creating and controlling an app chain centralizes everything, contradicting the decentralized nature of Ethereum.
- Building a custom rollup forfeits the security inherited from the Ethereum network.
- The fragmentation of liquidity and user base across multiple L2 solutions raises concerns about attracting Total Value Locked (TVL) to a custom chain and facilitating onboarding.

Thatâ€™s it for today, folks. See ya next Friday. ðŸ§¢
