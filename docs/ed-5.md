ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the 5rd edition of The OP Superchain Roundup! ðŸŒŸ

Join us as we uncover the exciting world of the Optimism Ecosystem. In this newsletter, we'll bring you all the latest updates and developments on the OP Ecosystem. Let's get started!

## Major happenings in the Ecosystem
### Base
#### Friend.tech Powering 20% of Base's Transaction Fee

- Friend.tech has contributed to almost 20% of Base's total transaction fees in a recent seven-day period..
- The app allows users to speculate on the popularity of personalities on X (formerly Twitter) and serves as a private chat room between influencers and their followers.
- It has become the most-used application on Base, surpassing other popular apps like LayerZero.
- Despite being in beta, Friend.tech has accumulated nearly $27 million in fees and has over $52 million in locked crypto on the platform.
- The app's success took its two-person team by surprise, and they are working on improving its infrastructure and economic model.
- Base creator Jesse Pollak believes that if Friend.tech continues to adapt and evolve with industry trends, it has a good chance of maintaining its momentum.

#### Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) Integrates with Base

- Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has been launched on Base.
- The integration aims to enable Base developers to build cross-chain applications and services across multiple blockchain networks.
- CCIP utilizes Chainlink's oracle networks to provide a secure means of sending messages, transferring tokens, and initiating transactions across different chains.
- Chainlink CCIP has been adopted by projects such as Raft, Nuon, Folks Finance, and Polychain Monsters on the Base Layer 2 network.
- Chainlink's CCIP has also been rolled out on other platforms like Arbitrum, Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon.
- The CCIP technology has demonstrated successful interoperability experiments with Swift, indicating its potential for bridging traditional financial systems and emerging blockchain technologies.

### Celo
#### Matter Labs Joins the Race for Celo's Ethereum Transition

- Celo proposed to transition from an independent "layer-1" status to a layer 2 network on Ethereum.
- Matter Labs, the creator of zkSync rollup, recently proposed their ZK Stack open-source software as an option for hosting Celo.
- The migration plan initially involved using Optimism's OP Stack software kit, which was also used by Coinbase's Base blockchain and Binance's BNB Chain's opBNB network.
- Polygon, a layer-2 solution, also offered its Polygon Chain Development Kit (Polygon CDK) as an alternative for Celo's new system.
- The competition among veteran layer-2 teams to provide technology for Celo's transition has intensified.

### Governance
#### Optimismâ€™s Security Council

- Optimism plans to establish a security council for its superchain network.
- The security council aims to ensure integrity and decentralization of the network.
- It will consist of at least eight members and require a 75% signature threshold for any actions.
- The council's establishment will involve governance proposals and community participation.
- It will function as a multi-signatory co-signatory, influencing network upgrades.
- Optimism intends to improve transparency, security, and decentralization of its network.

### Infrastructure
#### Caldera and Espresso Systems Introduce The First Optimistic Rollup with Decentralized Sequencing

- Caldera and Espresso Systems have unveiled Vienna, which is the first Optimistic Rollup to utilize Espresso's Decentralized Sequencer.
- The launch of Vienna's devnet allows developers and users to interact with a live Optimistic Rollup using a decentralized sequencer network.
- Traditional rollups rely on centralized sequencers, which pose issues such as single points of failure, potential censorship or transaction reordering, and lack of transparency in transaction ordering.
- By integrating Espresso's decentralized sequencer, Caldera aims to enhance security, integrity, and trust in the rollup network.
- In the Espresso Sequencer network, user transactions are sent to the Espresso Sequencer instead of the rollup node, and the sequencer orders them into blocks that are then executed by the rollup node.
- Caldera values collaboration with Espresso Systems and their commitment to decentralization and user security.
- The Vienna testnet is live and offers documentation, a block explorer, a faucet, and instructions for adding the chain to Metamask.

## Highlights of the Week
### OP Labs Launches 'Fault Proof' on Testnet

- OP Labs has launched its "fault proof" system as an alpha version on the OP Goerli Testnet.
- OP Labs is a research and development firm associated with the Optimism Collective, which governs the Optimism Layer 2 network on Ethereum.
- The system is designed to address a missing element in networks utilizing OP Labs' software and aims to build a multi-proof dispute system that incorporates zero-knowledge proofs.
- The alpha release of the fault proof system marks a significant step towards a more decentralized and efficient Superchain.

Our Thoughts: OP's been getting heat for security risks. The main worry is that transactions can be reversed or withdrawn by a central authority, which defeats the purpose of decentralization. This a certainly a move in the right direction.

Thatâ€™s it for today, folks. See ya next Friday. ðŸ§¢
