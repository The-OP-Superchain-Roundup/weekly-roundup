ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the 6th edition of The OP Superchain Roundup! ðŸŒŸ

- According to Messari's State of Ethereum report, Layer-2 networks accounted for 61% of all Ethereum transactions in the third quarter.
- The surge in Layer-2 transactions was driven by the launch of Base and the popularity of the friend.tech social token platform.
- Base, incubated by Coinbase, has seen significant growth and currently has a total value locked (TVL) of $448 million, making it one of the top layer-2 solutions.
- Arbitrum is the most utilized Layer-2 solution with 600,000 average daily transactions, but Base and Optimism have caused a decline in its network activity.
- The long-term expectation has always been that Layer-2 transactions would surpass those on Ethereum's mainnet.
- Layer-2 solutions are seen as a scalable alternative to Ethereum's limited block space, and they are expected to gain more adoption as reputable financial institutions embrace the technology.

- Backed Finance has launched a tokenized government bond on the Base Network, a layer-2 network built on Optimism's OP stack.

- Backed Finance aims to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs), such as equities, commodities, art, or collectibles, stored in bank accounts.
- Base Network was chosen for its promised support for builders and developers, and the collaboration began in February.

- Tangible's real estate stablecoin, Real USD (USDR), experienced a 50% crash in value due to a lack of liquidity caused by DAI redemptions.
- Approximately $12 million worth of DAI was redeemed against USDR, leaving the coin 60% backed by real estate.
- USDR is currently trading at $0.51.
- USDR holds around $5.6 million in liquidity at Velodrome on Optimism and $3.0 million in liquidity at Aerodrome on Base.
- Minting with the project-native TNGBL token is temporarily unavailable on the Tangible store.
- Tangible tokenizes real estate, gold, watches, and wine, using them as backing for the USDR token.
- The project owns 190 properties in the UK as NFTs, and gains from real estate investments are used to mint USDR and acquire more tokenized properties.

Thatâ€™s it for today, folks. See ya next Friday. ðŸ§¢
