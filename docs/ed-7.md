- Celestia, a modular blockchain network, has concluded its Genesis airdrop of its token $TIA.
- Only 33% of the eligible addresses claimed the airdrop, with 191,391 addresses participating out of a total of 576,653.
- The unclaimed tokens will be allocated to developers and accounts that had submitted addresses.
- Celestia's mainnet is expected to be live in the coming weeks, and airdrop participants will receive $TIA tokens directly in their wallets.

## Highlights of the Week

- Manta Pacific network recently launched using OP Stack as an optimistic rollup layer-2 solution.
- However, after only a few weeks, Manta has announced plans to transition to using Polygon's zkEVM and zk-rollup technology instead.
- This is seen as a blow to OP Stack, which had gained traction with projects like Coinbase's new layer-2 chain choosing it.
- ZK proofs can provide faster transaction "finality" than optimistic rollups currently offered by OP Stack.
- However, OP Labs insists zk-rollups are not a threat since OP Stack will eventually support validity proofs like ZK.
- A key reason for Manta's switch is concerns over security, as OP Stack still lacks fault proofs to secure transactions.
- Fault proofs are core to optimistic rollups but still in testing phases on OP Stack testnets.
- The move highlights ongoing competition between layer-2 infrastructure providers like OP Stack, Polygon, zkSync etc. to partner with new projects.

Thatâ€™s it for today, folks. See ya next Friday. ðŸ§¢
