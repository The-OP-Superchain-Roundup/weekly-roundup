ðŸŒŸ Welcome to the 9th edition of The OP Superchain Roundup! ðŸŒŸ 

Join us as we uncover the exciting world of the Optimism Ecosystem. In this newsletter, we'll bring you all the latest updates and developments on the OP Ecosystem. Let's get started!

## Major happenings in the Ecosystem
### Base
#### Maple Finance Joins Base Network to Serve Institutional Clients with Blockchain Credit Solutions

- Maple Finance has expanded its services to the Base network.
- Maple Finance allows firms to create their own credit facilities on the blockchain.
- The first offering on Base is Maple's Cash Management pool, which generates a 4.8% yield from short-duration U.S. treasuries.
- Room 40 Capital is the sole borrower of the Cash Management pool, using the proceeds to buy T-Bills.
- "Web3 corporate treasuries" are the primary users of this pool, followed by high-net-worth individuals.
- Maple Finance ensures compliance by conducting KYC/KYB and accredited investor checks for lenders in the Cash Management pool.
- The integration with Base provides access to thousands of Coinbase Institutional customers for Maple Finance.
- Maple Finance plans to launch additional pools on Base, offering a combination of private credit digital native opportunities and real-world yield sources.

#### Circle Launches Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) for Secure USDC Transfers on Base Mainnet

- Circle has launched its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) on the Base mainnet.
- The protocol allows secure transfers of USDC (USD Coin) between blockchains.
- USDC can now be transferred from Ethereum and other networks to the Base blockchain without permission.
- CCTP supports the transfer of USDC across 20 independent networks, reducing withdrawal delays.
- The protocol is natively supported in Base Bridge, enabling local burning and minting processes for USDC transfers.
- The launch of CCTP aims to enhance interoperability and accessibility of USDC across different blockchains.

### Infrastructure
#### Bringing ZK Proofs to the OP Stack

- The Optimism Foundation set forth Missions for growth and development within the Collective during Season 4 of Optimism Governance.
- Implementing a Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) for the OP Stack is a key part of achieving Technical Decentralization Intent.
- RISC Zero and O(1) Labs were accepted to work on the Mission to bring ZK Proofs to the OP Stack.
- RISC Zero aims to provide Rust-based ZK validity proofs through their RISC-V zkVM, enhancing user and developer experiences in areas such as withdrawals, bridging, and Superchain governance.
- O(1) Labs brings the ZK technology powering the Mina protocol to the OP Stack, aiming to eliminate the withdrawal window and enabling applications on the OP Stack to interact with the Mina Protocol.
- Both teams are committed to providing regular progress updates, and their work will have a significant impact on the Optimism ecosystem.
- A workshop on bringing ZK proofs to the OP Stack will be led by RISC Zero and O(1) Labs at Optimism's Onchain Summit at Devconnect in Istanbul.

#### Celestia Mainnet is Live

- Celestia has launched its mainnet beta after distributing its native TIA token to 580,000 users through an airdrop worth around $120 million.
- Celestia is a modular blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues by using specific channels for speed and execution. 
- It uses data availability sampling (DAS) to verify data.
- The mainnet launch enables other modular chains to use Celestia as a data availability and consensus layer. 
- This marks the arrival of the first live modular data availability network with DAS.

## Highlights of the Week
### Vitalik's Latest Paper on Layer 2 Solutions

- Vitalik released a new publication that talks about how how the Ethereum L2 ecosystem is becoming more diverse. 
- Different types of layer 2 solutions are emerging, including EVM rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism, Scroll, Kakarot, Taiko), sidechains (Polygon), and new efforts (Linea, Zeth).
- Layer 2 projects are becoming more heterogeneous, with various motivations driving their adoption.
- Transitioning from layer 1 to layer 2 is a gradual process for some projects to ensure usability and momentum.
- Centralized projects are exploring blockchain-based solutions to enhance security without sacrificing high throughput.
- Non-financial applications, like games and social media, seek a halfway-house level of security.
- Users from the non-blockchain world find it challenging to justify higher fees on layer 2 compared to their previous centralized systems.
- The choice between rollups, validiums, and disconnected systems depends on trade-offs between security guarantees, costs, and data availability.
- Ethereum's data availability is expected to improve over time, reducing costs.
- Application-specific needs and user experience play a crucial role in choosing the right layer 2 solution.
- Pre-confirmations can provide partial guarantees for low-value applications.
- Trustlessly reading the Ethereum blockchain is important for security and functionality.
- Having a bridge contract on Ethereum does not provide asset security guarantees on the top chain.
- Validating bridges and the ability to read Ethereum improve asset security and functionality on layer 2 solutions.

Thatâ€™s it for today, folks. See ya next Friday. ðŸ§¢
